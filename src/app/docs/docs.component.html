    <p>3D-Beacons is an open collaboration between providers of macromolecular structure models. This collaboration aims
      to provide model coordinates and meta-information from all the contributing data resources in a standardised data

    <p>The 3D-Beacons Network consists of a Registry, a Hub and data providers who host Clients. The
      <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-hub-api" target="_blank">3D-Beacons
        Hub</a> uses the <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-registry" target="_blank">
        3D-Beacons Registry</a> to look up which
      <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-client" target="_blank">3D-Beacon Client</a>
      supports what API endpoints. All Beacons APIs as well as the Beacons Hub provide data according to the
      <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-specifications/blob/main/oas3.yaml" target="_blank">
        3D-Beacons data specifications</a>. The Hub collates the data from
      the Beacons and exposes it via Hub API endpoints.</p>
    <p>Currently, 3D-Beacons Hub provides the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>URLs to, and description of every protein structure for a UniProt accession, for example:<br>
        <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/3dbeacons/api/uniprot/summary/P0DTD1.json" target="_blank">
          https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/3dbeacons/api/uniprot/summary/P0DTD1.json
        </a>
      </li>
<!--      <li>Functional annotations from PDBe-KB for a UniProt accession, for example,<br>-->
<!--        <a href="https://3d-beacons.org/api/uniprot/annotations/P0DTD1.json" target="_blank">-->
<!--          https://3d-beacons.org/api/uniprot/annotations/P0DTD1.json-->
<!--        </a>-->
<!--      </li>-->
    </ul>
    <p>The 3D-Beacons Hub API endpoints, such as shown above, can be used to programmatically access all
      the available protein structures and models from any members of the 3D-Beacons Network. For example,
      the API endpoint for the SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein, identified by its UniProt accession
      <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pdbe-kb/3dbeacons/api/uniprot/summary/P0DTD1.json" target="_blank">
        P0DTD1
      </a> provides all the experimentally determined structures from the PDB, as well as theoretical models from
      SWISS-MODEL and others.</p>
    <h3>Components of the 3D-Beacons infrastructure</h3>
    <p class="infra-label">3D-Beacons API specification</p>
    <p>The main purpose of 3D-Beacons is to provide programmatic access to experimentally determined and
      theoretical protein structures in a uniform manner. We have created a set of data exchange format
      specifications to ensure the uniformity of the data provided by all member Beacons.</p>
    <p>The specification is described on GitHub at
      <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-specifications/blob/production/oas3.yaml"
         target="_blank">https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-specifications (production branch)
      </a>
    </p>
    <p class="infra-label">3D-Beacons Registry</p>
    <p>The 3D-Beacons Registry contains information on which data providers are members of the 3D-Beacons Network,
      and which API specifications did they implement. This allows both the 3D-Beacons Hub and any users to find out
      what API endpoints are available from which data providers. For example, if users are only interested
      in getting data from SASBDB, they can check in the registry which API URLs they should use.</p>
    <p>The 3D-Beacons Registry is available at
      <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-registry" target="_blank">
        https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-registry
      </a>
    </p>
    <p class="infra-label">3D-Beacons Client</p>
    <p>The 3D-Beacons Client is a lightweight Python package that allows researchers to link their
      in-house models to the 3D-Beacons Network. It takes PDB and/or mmCIF files as input and generates
      the necessary metadata which is then exposed through a set of API endpoints that comply with the
      <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-specifications/blob/production/oas3.yaml" target="_blank">
        3D-Beacons data specifications</a>.</p>
    <p>The 3D-Beacons Client is publicly available at
      <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-client" target="_blank">
        https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-client
      </a>
    </p>
    <p class="infra-label">3D-Beacons Hub</p>
    <p>The 3D-Beacons Hub acts as an aggregator of data from the various members of the 3D-Beacons Network.
      It uses the <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-registry" target="_blank">
        3D-Beacons Registry
      </a> to look up which API endpoints are supported by which 3D-Beacons,
      retrieves the data, and collates it to present the combined metadata programmatically to users.</p>
    <p>The 3D-Beacons Hub source code is available at
      <a href="https://github.com/3D-Beacons/3d-beacons-hub-api" target="_blank">
